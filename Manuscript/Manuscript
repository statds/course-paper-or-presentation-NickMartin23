\begin{abstract}
In 2023 the music industry remains more divided than ever before, yet as a society we grow more and more connected each year through outlets like the internet or social media. What is the explanation for this? Most believe that with the progression of technology comes the ability to streamline information and media. An individual's ability to consume music looks much different nowadays than it did in the 1960’s. Streaming platforms have basically made it so that any child with a cellphone has access to millions of songs for free. A stark contrast from the earlier 20th centuries’ vinyl format. It is because of this evolution in media consumption that most people believe the charts are so segmented. With the internet people don't have to subject themselves to Pop radio in order to hear music. Specific tastes and sub genres can be discovered easily using Spotify for example; a streaming service that even recommends specific songs based on what you’ve already listened to. People's taste in music has become so specific this way. Now anyone is able to find songs and artists that exactly match their music taste regardless of the popularity of that artist. It is in this explanation that I hold a lot of stock in explaining why Billboard's 2023 Year End Top 100 songs chart contains such a variation of artists, and why the content of the songs on it vary as well. There is so much information that we can surmise by examining these year end lists. And although it may seem arbitrary, a lot of this information is being used in full effect by the music industry, not only to predict the popularity of the music, but as well to learn more about ourselves as a species and the way we’ve consumed media over time.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
For the purposes of this statistical analysis my main goal is simple. I aim to explore the use of statistical models in order to predict musical trends for the year 2023. For this task I am using the year end top100 list from Billboard and I am using data from RouteNote for the variables I will be using. I chose this particular topic since it pertains to me greatly as a musician and music listener. But these types of studies are deeply important in finding out more about ourselves and our habits over time. It is of course very important for people who are a part of the music industry as well. Because of this, prior research has of course been done on this topic generally extensively. People have been using chart data for years to predict trends. This is a popular practice for the boardroom category of song writing. However, It is with the year almost at its end that I turn my focus to 2023, where I will use data from the year in order to predict a song's potentially chart position. I will start off by examining the data, after which I will use General Linear Regression in order to create some models for the project. Finally I aim to use song data from other years to predict how well a track would’ve done on the chart in 2023.\\

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

For the actual track list that I will be using to make my predictions I am using the 2023 Billboard top 100 year end chart. Billboard basically has taken into account all aspects of each song's performance. This includes: airplay, sales, and jukebox activity aswell; which includes streams. Billboard then creates a point system which typically gives sales more weight than the other variables as purchases of a song are a great indicator that that song is particularly popular. And from their point system Billboard compiles the year end statistics for 2023; the song with the most streams and sales and airplay gets the first spot and the other 99 most popular songs of the year comprise the rest of the list. It is an extremely useful and regulated tool to get popular song data from. And it is important to note that Billboard compiles their data across all genres. For the actual music data that I will be using I have enlisted the help of RouteNote which is an extremely useful tool that calculates data based on individual songs. This data includes several variables including: track length, BPM, and key. The song dataset that I will be working with contains 6 columns; 5 independent variables and a dependent variable. It contains the year end chart position for each song on the 2023 Billboard chart, artist name, bpm, track length, energy coefficient and valence coefficient. All of the variables that I have acquired from RouteNote are gathered using Spotify’s AI which uses machine learning in order to determine metadata on a particular song.\\

\begin{table}

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Artist & & Track Length & BPM & Energy & Valence \\
    \hline
    Morgan Wallen - 8 & Min. & 109 & 67.2 & 9.1 & 3.9 \\
    SZA - 4 & 1st Qu. & 176.8 & 106.4 & 51.5 & 33.55 \\
    Drake - 3 & Median & 196.5 & 129 & 61.9 & 51.05 \\
    Luke Combs - 3 & Mean & 196.8 & 127.6 & 62.21 & 50.94 \\
    Taylor Swift - 3 & 3rd Qu. & 222 & 145.2 & 74.25 & 67.33 \\
    Bailey Zimmerman - 2 & Max. & 277 & 203.9 & 96.5 & 96.1 \\
    \hline

  \caption{Summary of Top 100 Data}
  \label{Summary}
\end{table}

In order to conduct the model building segment of our statistical analysis latter we must encode the categorical variable within this dataset so that when we use Rstudio we can perform linear regression. Similarly I have converted the track length variable which is in format (M:SS) into a numerical value representing how long each song is in seconds. Further summarizing the data will tell us more even more information. We can see that it was a particularly good year for Morgan Wallen who had 8 songs on the Billboard charts this year doubling second places SZA. We can predict that the artist variable may have significant pull when it comes to our final model; as it definitely payed to be Morgan Wallen in 2023.\\

  \caption{Histograms of Independent Variables}
  \label{fig:Hist1}
\end{figure}[h]

I have plotted histograms for the four numeric variables in our dataset and the results are as shown. We can see the individual distributions for Track Length, BPM, Energy, and Valence. As we can see from the plots, none of these distributions look particularly bad. We can see that they all roughly display normality, and there are no bars that extend abnormally far away from the rest of the distribution. Similarly we can see that no bars in any of the Histograms hang abnormally tall; this suggests no existence of any outliers within our dataset. This is important information because it means that we can now check
