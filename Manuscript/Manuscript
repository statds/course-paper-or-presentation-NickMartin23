\begin{abstract}
In 2023 the music industry remains more divided than ever before, yet as a society we grow more and more connected each year through outlets like the internet or social media. What is the explanation for this? Most believe that with the progression of technology comes the ability to streamline information and media. An individual's ability to consume music looks much different nowadays than it did in the 1960’s. Streaming platforms have basically made it so that any child with a cellphone has access to millions of songs for free. A stark contrast from the earlier 20th centuries’ vinyl format. It is because of this evolution in media consumption that most people believe the charts are so segmented. With the internet people dont have to subject themselves to Pop radio in order to hear music. Specific tastes and subgenres can be discovered easily using Spotify for example; a streaming service that even recommends specific songs based on what you’ve already listened to. People's taste in music has become so specific this way. Now anyone is able to find songs and artists that exactly match their music taste regardless of the popularity of that artist. It is in this explanation that I hold a lot of stock in explaining why Billboard's 2023 Year End Top 100 songs chart contains such a variation of artists, and why the content of the songs on it varry aswell. There is so much information that we can surmise by examining these year end lists. And although it may seem arbitrary, a lot of this information is being used in full effect by the music industry, not only to predict the popularity of the music, but as well to learn more about ourselves as a species and the way we’ve consumed media over time.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

From an industry perspective, increasing the means to predict trends in music is very important should you want the public to be receptive of your work. It is as a musician myself that I find this very fascinating. If one were able to predict exactly what kind of music the public would receive most positivley they'd have had it made. Intruiging from the financial respective of record lables and distributors as well. As well what could be more important to any buisness nowadays than being at the forefront of the wave of Artificial Intelligence. Very little research has been done on preciscly this topic, yet much research has been done on the trend of human happiness and the emotional aspect of music respectivley. I aim specifically to use the trends which appeared in music from 2011-2022 as a means to experiment with the possibility of predicting a population mood trend using said data. I aim to identify a correlation between the Happiness/Sadness of a Population and those same traits in popular music. For this project I will use data from the World Happiness Report \cite{ushappiness}.

% roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The data will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:data}.
The methods are described in Section~\ref{sec:meth}.
The results are reported in Section~\ref{sec:resu}.
A discussion concludes in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

The data from the World Happiness Report is collected world wide through the Gallup World Poll. For my purposes I will just be using Data from the United States. Thw World Happiness report has data from 2011 then 2014-2022 Providing an index for each year based on Americans responses to the poll. The following question was prompted “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder
would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” \cite{ushappiness} Figure~\ref{fig:happiness} above shows the average response per year.

I am going to compare the trend of US Happiness and Life Satisfaction to that of the trend in Music across the 2010's. \cite{sadamericans} Cyanite.ai is a project that uses spotify AI to break songs down into there core moods. I will collect songs from the year end top 100 list from the years 2011 and 2014-2022 and feed them into Cyanite.ai in order to calculate the core moods from each song. Usings Cyanite.ai I have received this information from 2011. For the Full Project I will include the remaining Years.
